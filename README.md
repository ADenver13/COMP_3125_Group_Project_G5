# COMP 3125 Group Project - Amtrak Data Analysis
Hello! This is a final project for DS 3125 (Data Science Fundamentals) at Wentworth Institute of Technology. For this project we pulled together a variety of Amtrak data sources and analysed Amtrak performance data. This project was completed by Aiden Dever, Steven Lugo, Nilay Patel.

## Code Structure
If all of the notebooks were kept together, things would get quite messy. To keep things simple, they're seperated into our two main data sources (BTS and Dixie-Land). Each folder is seperated into data, graphs, and code (analysis). This last folder is where you can find the notebooks that produce the graphs in the graph folder.

## Data Sources
- [Dixie-Land](https://dixielandsoftware.net/Amtrak/status/StatusMaps/#options) (Open-Source Granular Amtrak Data)
- [BTS](https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/state-transportation-statistics/amtrak-ridership) (Bureau of Transportation Statistics)
- [Meteostat](https://meteostat.net/en/) (Python Library for Weather Data)

## Running the Notebooks

Unfortunately many of our data sources are too large for Github. In order to remedy this, parsed data can be obtained by running the data parsing scripts or by contacting the project owners.
